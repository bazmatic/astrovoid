"""Fire control: the firing solution the hunter tracks and holds fire for.

The pilot decides whether to engage. Holding a nose within a few degrees of a
target is beyond a pilot that chooses a few times a second, so that last part
belongs to the ship: it trims the nose onto the solution found here and
releases shots only when the solution says they will hit.
